This is the repository for Project Tao, a project that aims to create balance in competitive Pokemon Battling. We are working on a custom Pokemon Showdown server where Pokemon will receive changes to various aspects about them. The project is currently in its very first stages so the current files are just the basic PS files or ones that may have minor changes. Credit goes to Zarel for all of these, I made none of them myself. The original code was downloaded from https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown.
